ABOUT:
  this .slx file allows users to analyze physical analog input signals via an arduino unit
  and resulting digital representation of the analog output of a simple negative feedback control system modeled in SIMULINK.
  The model includes a converter module for Analog-digital signal processing, and a gain aplifier 
  The methods of observing come from simulink inbuilt oscilliscope and basic display modules.
  
Users are free to use the file and make adjustments to the model based on thier own analysis specification, and are free to pull for commits regarding improved design and related application documentation.
